# Crime-Statistics-Simulation
# This is a simulation of how a crime statistics database works. Queries can be executed in order to gain valuable information and construct policies accordingly
# Please note you must have MYSQL Workbench and initialize a local server to run this project.
Run "Project_DBW_1" to initialize the database.
Then open "project_main_queries" to see all the test queries and copy and paste those queries in MYSQL workbench inside "Project_DBW_queries" to see the outcome for yourself. 
Your can view "project_database" to get a better understanding of the tables and various primary/foreign keys.
If any errors regarding tables/database is encountered, try running "Project_DBW" file to drop and the recreate all data using "Project_DBW_1".
